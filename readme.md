# I AM

Have you every seen those little cards people make with information about themselves on. You know. The ones that are node packages. The ones where you go `npx samuelbeard` and it displays it in the terminal.

I figured, instead of everyone making their own, lets make one BIG one that everyone can contribute to!

```
npx i-be samuelbeard
```
![example](./example.png)

## How it works

Simply run the command below with your username to get back your personal card.

```sh
npx i-be {username}

# eg:
npx i-be samuelbeard
```

> For yours to work, you will need to create it. Have a read of the contributing section below.
